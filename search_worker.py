"""VGI worker exposing unified web search to DuckDB/SQL.

Assembles the functions in ``vgi_search`` into a single ``search`` catalog and
runs the worker over stdio (a DuckDB subprocess) or HTTP (via serve.py).

Search is an **egress connector**: queries leave the engine for a third-party
search API. It is commodity access -- a thin wrapper whose value lives in the
upstream subscription, not the worker -- so it is built as AI-stack glue, framed
honestly (see README.md). The durable value is the pluggable-provider surface.

Usage:
    uv run search_worker.py              # serve over stdio (DuckDB subprocess)
    python serve.py --port 8000          # serve over HTTP

    INSTALL vgi FROM community; LOAD vgi;
    ATTACH 'search' (TYPE vgi, LOCATION 'uv run search_worker.py');

    SELECT title, url, snippet
      FROM search.web_search('duckdb arrow protocol', provider := 'brave', count := 10);
    SELECT search.web_answer('who maintains duckdb', 'tavily');
    SELECT * FROM search.search_providers();

Provider API keys are supplied via the VGI **secret provider** (one secret type
per keyed provider: brave/tavily/exa/serpapi/serper); for local dev / CI they may
fall back to the ``<PROVIDER>_API_KEY`` env vars. Keys are NEVER passed in SQL.

    "# Unified Web Search in SQL\n\n"
    "Query the live web directly from DuckDB SQL through one pluggable provider surface that "
    "unifies **Brave Search**, **Tavily**, **Exa**, **SearXNG**, and **DuckDuckGo** behind a single "
    "result schema -- built for RAG, retrieval, and agent grounding.\n\n"
    "This extension turns web search into a first-class SQL data source. Instead of wiring a "
    "different HTTP client and JSON shape for every search API, you call one table function and get "
    "back the same unified rows -- `title`, `url`, `snippet`, `rank`, `source`, `published`, `score`, "
    "and an `extra` JSON column for provider-specific fields -- no matter which provider served the "
    "query. It is designed for developers building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, "
    "search-driven analytics, and AI agents that need fresh, citable web results inside the database, "
    "with the ability to swap or A/B providers without rewriting a single query.\n\n"
    "Under the hood the worker is a thin, dependency-light connector: every provider is reached over "
    "plain HTTP with the [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) client "
    "([source](https://github.com/encode/httpx)) -- no heavyweight provider SDKs are bundled. Each "
    "backend is a small adapter that maps the upstream JSON into the shared result shape, with a "
    "per-call timeout plus bounded retry/backoff on rate-limit and server errors so a flaky provider "
    "never crashes the engine. Because it is an egress connector, results and quotas come from your "
    "own upstream subscription: API keys are supplied through the VGI secret provider (one secret "
    "type per keyed provider) and are **never** passed inline in SQL, while DuckDuckGo works key-free.\n\n"
    "The function surface is intentionally small. The table function "
    "`web_search(query, provider := ..., count := ..., page := ...)` runs one search against the "
    "chosen provider and streams the ranked, unified rows with 0-based page pagination. The scalar "
    "`web_answer(query, provider)` returns a single synthesized one-line answer (via Tavily or the "
    "free DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API) or NULL when none is available. The table function "
    "`search_providers()` lists every provider and whether each currently has a key or base URL "
    "configured. Typical SQL looks like "
    "`SELECT title, url, snippet FROM search.web_search('duckdb arrow protocol', provider := 'brave', "
    "count := 10)` for retrieval, or `SELECT search.web_answer('who maintains duckdb', 'tavily')` for "
    "a quick fact.\n\n"
